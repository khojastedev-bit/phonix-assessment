# Subscription Management API

A clean, scalable subscription management system built with ASP.NET Core 8 and Clean Architecture.

## üèó Architecture & Technology Choices

### Why This Structure?
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability
- **CQRS with MediatR**: Clear separation of reads and writes, better scalability
- **Entity Framework Core**: Productivity and strong LINQ support
- **SQLite**: Fast development and easy setup for this assessment
- **Result Pattern**: Explicit error handling and better API responses

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models with business logic
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction over data access
3. **MediatR Pipeline**: Easy to add cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, caching)
4. **Explicit Error Handling**: Result pattern for clear success/failure states

## üöÄ If This Were Production Scale

### Immediate Changes:
- **Database**: Switch to PostgreSQL or SQL Server with proper indexing
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed subscription plans
- **Background Jobs**: Hangfire for subscription expiration handling
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights and structured logging with Serilog

### Scalability Enhancements:
- **Event Sourcing**: For audit trails and complex business workflows
- **Microservices**: Split into separate services for billing, notifications, etc.
- **Message Queue**: Azure Service Bus/RabbitMQ for async processing
- **API Gateway**: For rate limiting and API composition

### Security & Compliance:
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with proper claims
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Audit Logging**: Track all subscription changes
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data anonymization and deletion workflows

## ‚è± Time Spent

## ü§ñ AI Assistance

**Used AI for:**
- Initial project structure brainstorming
- Boilerplate code generation for entities and configurations
- README template and documentation structure
- Validation of architectural decisions

**No AI used for:**
- Business logic implementation
- API design decisions
- Database schema design
- Error handling strategies
